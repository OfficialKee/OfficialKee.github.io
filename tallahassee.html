        in Florida's Capitol over the years have reflected the growth of the state. In the early 1820s, legislators
        transferred
        government business from St. Augustine to Pensacola for alternating sessions. Travel was hazardous and took
        almost
        twenty days - clearly an unsatisfactory arrangement. As a result, Tallahassee was chosen as the capital of
        American
        Florida in 1824, primarily because it was the midway point between the two principal cities.
        <br />

        

        The history of Tallahassee, Florida, is both extensive and diverse. From its origins as a land inhabited by Native American tribes like the Apalachee, Creek, and Seminole peoples, to the arrival of European explorers such as Hernando de Soto in 1539, the region has witnessed significant events. Spanish attempts to establish missions aimed at converting indigenous populations to Christianity marked the colonial period. The area's control oscillated between the Spanish and British due to conflicts like the Seven Yearsâ€™ War, with Florida eventually returning to Spanish rule after the American Revolutionary War. Today, Tallahassee stands as the capital city of Florida, a testament to its enduring historical significance.

        Three log cabins served as Florida's first Capitol. In 1826, a two-story masonry building, 40' X 26', was built.
        It was
        to be the wing of a larger sturcture planned for the future. Although this larger portion was started, it was
        never
        completed due to financial problems.

        As Florida moved toward statehood, the needs of government grew. There arose a demand for a suitable state house
        or
        public building for the use of the Territorial Legislature. On March 3, 1839, Congress appropriated $20,000 for
        the
        erection of a new Capitol. The old structure was razed immediately, and Florida's government temporarily moved
        into
        rented quarters.
