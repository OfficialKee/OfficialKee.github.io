        Various indigenous groups have inhabited the lands of Florida for over 14,000 years. In 1513, Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León was the first documented European to arrive, naming the area La Florida ([la floˈɾiða] in Spanish) for its abundant floral beauty and the Easter season (Pascua Florida). Florida thus became the first region in the continental United States to be permanently settled by Europeans, marked by the establishment of the Spanish colony of St. Augustine in 1565, which remains the oldest continuously inhabited city in the country. Over time, Florida witnessed numerous conflicts between Spain and Great Britain until it was ceded to the United States in 1819. It officially joined the Union as the 27th state on March 3, 1845. Notably, Florida was a significant theater of the Seminole Wars (1816–1858), the lengthiest and most far-reaching of the Indian Wars in American history. On January 10, 1861, Florida seceded from the Union, becoming one of the original seven Confederate States. Following the Civil War, it was readmitted to the Union on June 25, 1868.

        <blockquote>
          "The current design of Florida's state flag was adopted in 1900. In that year, Florida voters ratified a
          constitutional amendment based on an 1899 joint resolution of the state legislature to add diagonal red bars,
          in the form of a St. Andrew's cross, to the flag.
